Figure \ref{fig:22_map_7} plots the trajectory of the robot for an experiment
performed at KTH's Smart Mobility Lab of the Automatic Control Department. The
robot was initially placed in the vicinity of node 3. Its first goal was
dictated to be node 5, and from there, nodes 1 and 2.

The robot's bearing and distance tolarance from a target was set to
$\xi = 4^{\circ}$ and the distance tolerance to $\delta$ = 6 cm. The controller's
gains were set to

$$(\dfrac{K_{\Psi}^R}{K_{\Psi,max}^R}, \dfrac{K_{\omega}^T}{K_{\omega, max}^T}, \dfrac{K_{\omega}^R}{K_{\omega,max}^R}, \dfrac{K_{\Psi}^T}{K_{\Psi,max}^T})
\equiv (0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5)$$
where $K_{*,max} > 0$.

The robot's distance errors from nodes 5, 1 and 2 were $e_5 = 7.07$ cm,
$e_1 = 8.54$ cm and $e_2 = 9.06$ cm respectively.
