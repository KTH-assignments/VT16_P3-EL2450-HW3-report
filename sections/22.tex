Figure \ref{fig:22_map_7} plots the trajectory of the robot for an experiment
performed at KTH's Smart Mobility Lab of the Automatic Control Department. The
robot was initially placed in the vicinity of node 2. Its first goal was
dictated to be node 1, and from there, nodes 5 and 3.

The robot's bearing and distance tolarance from a target was set to
$\xi = 4^{\circ}$ and the distance tolerance to $\delta$ = 6 cm. The controller's
gains were set to

$$(\dfrac{K_{\Psi}^R}{K_{\Psi,max}^R}, \dfrac{K_{\omega}^T}{K_{\omega, max}^T}, \dfrac{K_{\omega}^R}{K_{\omega,max}^R}, \dfrac{K_{\Psi}^T}{K_{\Psi,max}^T})
\equiv (0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5)$$
where $K_{*,max} > 0$.

The robot's distance errors from nodes 1, 5 and 3 were $e_1 = 7.42$ cm,
$e_5 = 7.07$ cm and $e_1 = 8.54$ cm and respectively.

It wasn't before this experiment that we considered a
positive $K_{\omega}^T$, instead of a negative one, as the theoretical analysis
pointed to. The second component of the line-following controller showed
significantly worse performance when $K_{\omega}^T < 0$ than when $K_{\omega}^T > 0$.

When the robot was asked to go from node 2 to node 1, the angle between it and
node 1 was $1.68^{\circ} < \xi = 4^{\circ}$. Hence, the robot first executed
line-following, and not rotation. The augmented error in distance,
relative to the other two, is hence the fact that $K_{\omega}^T < 0$ during the
experimental phase.
