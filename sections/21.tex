Reaching a certain accuracy is difficult. First one has to
orient and then to translate. As there is no automatic line-following, one
has to correct many times to reach a certain point, while reaching a certain
area should be easier. The accuracy in both bearing and distance is related
to the sensitivity of the motors driving the wheels to their input signals and
their output rotation precision.
