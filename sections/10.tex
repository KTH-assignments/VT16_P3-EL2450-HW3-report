This part of the controller is responsible for compensating translational errors
during rotation. Since the rotational speed $u_{\Psi}$ is zero, then it is
expected that the robot will not move away from its origin. Figure
\ref{fig:10_0.5_max} plots the robot's distance from its origin over time for
$K_{\omega}^R = 0.5 K_{\omega, max}^R$.
