This part of the controller is responsible for compensating for rotational
errors during translation. Since the translational velocity $u_{\omega}$ is zero,
it is expected that the robot will not rotate away from its original
bearing. Figure \ref{fig:16_0.5_min} plots the robot's bearing with regard to
its original bearing of $0$ degrees over time for $K_{\Psi}^T = 0.5 K_{\Psi, min}^T$.
