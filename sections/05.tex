From what we can see in the continuous and discrete state trajectory plot in
figure \ref{fig:05}, there is no zeno behaviour. There may be an infinite amount
of state switches, but they do not happen in an finite amount of time. The
zero-order-hold implemented in this system holds the current value until the
next sampling time instant. Therefore, the system's reaction time is limited by
the ZOH and therefore it can not exhibit zeno behaviour.

$\dot{\theta}=R /Lu_\Psi$ is marginally stable, as it does not go to zero but
as well not to instability.
